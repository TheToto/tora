# tora

This class isn't very user friendly, because it is as close as possible from [the Haxe source](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/tora/blob/master/tora/Protocol.hx).
You have to override class functions `onData` and `onError` (and other if needed).

See https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/tora/

TODO: Use events.
